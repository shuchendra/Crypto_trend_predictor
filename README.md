# Crypto_Trend_Predictor
* Develop a Python program that can automatically trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others on various cryptocurrency exchanges. The goal is to create an algorithm that analyzes market data, such as price movements and trading volume, to make buying and selling decisions without human intervention.

* The algorithm will be based on certain trading strategies or indicators, such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), or Bollinger Bands, to identify potential opportunities in the market. For example, it might buy a cryptocurrency when its price exceeds a certain moving average and sell it when it falls below another moving average.

## Steps Involved :
* Fetch Cryptocurrency market prices and data
* Perform basic analysis of market behavior
* Implement a simple algorithmic trading strategy
* Analyze the performance of the trading algorithm

* Collect Market Data: We'll use APIs provided by cryptocurrency exchanges to fetch real-time market data, including prices, trading volume, and order book information.
* Analyze Market Data: We'll use various technical analysis techniques to analyze the market data and identify potential trading signals.
* Make Trading Decisions: Based on the analysis, the algorithm will make decisions on whether to buy, sell, or hold a particular cryptocurrency.
